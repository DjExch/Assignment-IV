Wheatstone–Playfair cipher

Wheatstone–Playfair cipher is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first literal di-gram substitution cipher.  The technique encrypts pairs of letters (bigrams or di-grams), instead of single letters as in the simple substitution cipher. In this assignment I will expect from you to develop system that uses Playfair cipher to encrypt and decrypt given input. Developed application should have following features;

1)      Application should use Command Line mode. GUI not required. All developments should be done on github account.

2)      While application start should take key for create 5x5 matrix (repeated letter in key must be dismissed)    

3)      Application should ask for operation mode (Encrypt/Decrypt). According that application should get input than according to operation mode process input. Please check from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher or from notes how Playfair cipher is working.

4)      After process input result should be printed to screen.
